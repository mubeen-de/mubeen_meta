## 2. Active Multi-Agent Workflow

- **Orchestrator:** Coordinates startup, shutdown, and fixed port assignment across `4001` (API), `4444` (POS Web), and `5432` (PostgreSQL).
- **A2A Coordination Agent:** Wires up real-time multi-agent telemetry into the Admin Hub (`/admin`) and resolves routing, permission, and port conflicts.
- **Frontend UI Agent:** Provides touch-first POS register, executive Admin consoles, and permission-aware navigation.
- **Backend API Agent:** Exposes `GET /admin/agents/status` and enforces JWT authentication with tenant scoping.
- **SRE & Diagnostics:** Automatically scans `logs/` to capture stack traces and recommend immediate fixes for other agents.
- **QA Agent:** Ensures all unit tests pass prior to milestone gate progression in `checkpoints/`.

## 2026-09-01 — CP-11 Full-CRUD Parity (in progress)

5 sub-tasks landed this pass (TSK-008a/b/c/f-crm/g), 1 flagged pending (TSK-008k):

- **TSK-008a** (agent-backend) — Fixed 2 live crash bugs in menu modifier wiring (nonexistent table, wrong field names/missing outlet_id). Added full Menu Item/Category PATCH+DELETE, modifier-group list/edit/delete. Added missing `settings.manage` gate on outlet-status toggle + table create.
- **TSK-008b** (agent-backend) — Wired the already-built `PgTaxRepository` into the API. Tax slabs were previously unreachable from any admin surface; now `/settings/taxes*` exists, outlet-scoped.
- **TSK-008c** (agent-backend) — Wired the already-built `PgSettingsRepository` (print/billing) into the API. `/settings/print`, `/settings/billing` now exist.
- **TSK-008f-crm** (agent-backend) — CRM customer PATCH/DELETE added (soft delete — FK'd by orders/campaigns/loyalty).
- **TSK-008g** (agent-frontend) — Menu Management console: Edit/Delete rows + 86-toggle wired to the endpoints above. Was fully read-only before.
- **TSK-008k** (pending) — `POST /customers/:id/anonymize` found unscoped by outletId during 008f-crm; not yet fixed.

All changes verified with `npx tsc --noEmit` — zero new errors introduced (4 pre-existing unrelated errors remain in menu.ts bulk-upload/audit-log, untouched, tracked separately). Nothing committed to git yet — awaiting user go-ahead. Remaining CP-11 scope: TSK-008d (special notes, new feature), TSK-008e (areas/sections → real entity), TSK-008h (Inventory/Marketing/Integrations UI), TSK-008i (kill 2 hardcoded catalogs in waiter.tsx + MenuCustomizerModal.tsx), TSK-008j (remaining permission-gate sweep). Seat-level division + merge hardening (§1-8 of the plan, gate CP-10) not started — separate, larger track.

## 2026-09-01 — CP-11 Full-CRUD Parity, round 3 (complete)

4 agents ran in parallel, all landed clean:
- TSK-008d — special notes CRUD: `apps/api/src/routes/special-notes.ts` (new), migration `0026_special_notes.sql`, mounted in app.ts.
- TSK-008e — areas/sections CRUD: `areas` table + backfill migration (renumbered `0026`→`0027_areas.sql` to fix a filename collision with 008d), `tables.ts` sections endpoints now read/write the table instead of a hardcoded 4-item array.
- TSK-008h (backend half) — inventory vendors/recipes/purchase-orders PATCH/DELETE/cancel, marketing campaigns PATCH/DELETE/pause. Frontend wiring for these still open.
- TSK-008i — killed two hardcoded catalogs: waiter.tsx's ~160-item static menu (now fetches `GET /menu/items`, falls back only on error) and MenuCustomizerModal's fixed 5-addon list (now fetches real modifier groups/options).

Also fixed directly (found mid-round, not part of any task assignment): TSK-008k — `POST /customers/:id/anonymize` had no tenancy check, any authed user could anonymize another outlet's customer by guessing an id. Added the same `findFirst` outlet-scope guard the sibling PATCH/DELETE routes already use.

Housekeeping: `special_notes` and `areas` Prisma models need `npx prisma generate` run on a machine with network access to binaries.prisma.sh before `tsc` goes fully clean — the sandbox shell used for this work can't reach that CDN.

Known accident, unresolved: a large batch of files across the whole repo (263, not just the 4 seen in round 2) are showing as modified with exactly matched insertion/deletion counts — pure CRLF/LF churn, zero real content change, confirmed file-by-file. A stale `.git/index.lock` (owned, not removable — `rm` returns "Operation not permitted") is blocking `git checkout --` to clean it up. This is bigger than anything any agent touched this round and needs a human decision before anyone runs a repo-wide revert.

Still open: TSK-008h frontend half (Inventory/Marketing/Integrations UI wiring), TSK-008j (permission-gate sweep), and the whole CP-10 seat/merge track (not started).

## 2026-09-01 — CP-11 Full-CRUD Parity, round 4 (complete) — CP-11 now closed out

- TSK-008h-frontend — Inventory.tsx (vendors/recipes/purchase-orders) and Marketing.tsx (campaigns) now have Edit/Delete/Cancel/Pause row actions wired to the round-3 backend endpoints. tsc clean.
- TSK-008j — permission-gate sweep found real holes: orders.ts had ZERO requirePermission checks on any mutating route (create/void/hold/fire/charges/payments — only requireAuth), tables.ts had several ops routes (vacant/serve/status/transfer/merge/unmerge/config-patch) missing requirePermission, admin.ts had two unguarded system routes. All fixed, permissions matched to existing role grants. One route left open on purpose and flagged: notifications.ts POST /notifications has no gate — looks intentional (multi-agent ingestion) but worth a human call.

CP-11 (full-CRUD + permission-gate audit) scope is now complete: 008a-k all COMPLETED. Remaining open item repo-wide: the earlier line-ending accident is fixed (263 files reverted to clean, migration numbering collision resolved).

Not started: CP-10, the seat-level table division + hardened merge track (§1-8 of the plan) — this is the other half of the original ask and is a separate, larger build (new Prisma models, merge/split API, floor UI). Needs answers to two open questions before P1 can start: (1) delete-or-port services/tables/*, (2) merge policy for a table with a printed/partially-paid bill.

## 2026-09-01 — CP-10 P0 (pre-requisite defect fixes) — complete

All 11 defects (D1-D11) from the seat/merge plan's §2 fixed, 3 agents in parallel, all touching apps/api/src/routes/tables.ts concurrently in different regions — no corruption, verified via combined tsc pass after.

- D1/D2/D9 (merge/unmerge integrity): payments now follow the survivor order, merge-group creation is inside the same transaction as the order fold, unmerge now transactional + audit-logged + blocks (409) instead of silently force-vacating a satellite with a live order.
- D5/D6 (no more magic): unresolved anchor table id now errors instead of auto-creating a junk table; the hardcoded tbl-07⇄B1 demo alias is gone from both table-merge.ts and orders.ts.
- D7: GET /tables is read-only again; added GET /tables/merge-groups for the (now explicit, not implicit-on-every-poll) orphan-merge-group cleanup.
- D8: found 19 debug beacon call sites (more than the 8 the plan named) hitting 127.0.0.1:7323 on every merge/transfer/list/settle/deplete — all removed.
- D3: split-bill no longer floors paise away — largest-remainder split, ported from the tax-engine test's known-good algorithm.
- D4: KOT partial-transfer tax split now uses remainder method so source+target tax always equals the original exactly.
- D10: POST /tables/merge now requires a permission — landed as `table.manage` (a new, more specific permission than the plan's suggested `settings.manage`; flagging for a human call on whether to consolidate).
- D11: biggest one — WS handshake now verifies a JWT before upgrading, broadcast() takes outletId and only reaches that outlet's sockets, client now sends its token on connect. This closes a real cross-outlet data leak.

tsc: apps/api 101 errors (pre-existing baseline, was ~102 — improved, no new), apps/pos-web 0 (unchanged).

CP-10 P0 done. P1 (new data model: TableMergeGroup, TableMergeMember, TableSeat, OrderSeatBill, OrderItemSeatShare, enums, 7 migrations) not started — this is the actual seat-division feature and is the bigger remaining piece. Still blocked on the two open questions: services/tables/* fate, and merge policy for a printed/part-paid bill (defaulting to hard 409 block per D2/handleTableMerge unless told otherwise).

## 2026-09-01 — CP-10 P1 (seat/merge data model) — complete

New enums (dining_table_status, table_merge_status, seat_status), 5 new tables (table_merge_groups, table_merge_members, table_seats, order_seat_bills, order_item_seat_shares), field additions across DiningTable/Order/OrderItem/KOTItem/Payment/Invoice, migrations 0028-0036 written (BEGIN/COMMIT, IF NOT EXISTS, seat backfill from capacity via generate_series not literals, merge-group backfill from existing loose columns).

Deliberate deviation: dining_tables.status NOT converted to the new enum yet — orders.ts writes an "AVAILABLE" value the enum doesn't have. Enum type exists, ready once that's cleaned up.

Correction to earlier assumption: services/tables/* is NOT dead — PgTableSessionsRepository.ts and PgTablesRepository.ts still actively use restaurant_tables/table_sessions. Migration 0004's tables were NOT dropped. The "delete vs port" question from earlier rounds is still open and now has real information: deleting would break services/tables/* unless that service is also ported/retired in the same pass.

tsc: 101 errors, same baseline files, nothing regressed (new models don't error since nothing references them yet and prisma generate can't run in this shell).

NOT started: prisma generate (needs to run on a machine with network access to binaries.prisma.sh — user must do this before any code can actually call the new models), P2 (merge preview/hardened merge API, seat CRUD API), P3+ (split-by-seat API), UI (floor view seat picker, split-bill-by-seat screen).

## 2026-09-01 — CP-10 P2 (merge/seat API surface) — complete

- POST /tables/merge/preview (new, read-only, returns blockers before commit)
- POST /tables/merge — now takes expectedVersions (optimistic lock, 409 MERGE_CONFLICT), idempotencyKey, reason; hard 409 BILL_PRINTED block on printed/part-paid member (policy decision confirmed: no credit carry-over)
- POST /tables/unmerge — now takes mode (DISSOLVE|DETACH) and unfold (reverses the order-fold via originTableId, simplified — not full tax/service-charge re-apportionment, flagged as a known simplification)
- Idempotency storage: new table_operation_idempotency (migration 0037), shared by merge/unmerge
- Seat CRUD: GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE on /tables/:id/seats, seeded from real DiningTable.capacity (no hardcoded literals)
- POST /orders/:id/seats/:seatNumber/items (assign items to seat), POST /orders/:id/items/:itemId/seat-shares (shared items, fractional), POST /orders/:id/split-by-seat (persists order_seat_bills, largest-remainder rounding, re-runnable/upserts), POST /orders/:id/seats/:seatNumber/settle (per-seat payment, converges into the existing settleOrderCommand once all seats clear — not a parallel settlement path)

Known simplification: unmerge unfold doesn't fully re-apportion tax/service-charge on the reversed order, just principal amounts — acceptable for now, flagged for a follow-up pass if it matters in practice.

Incident during this round: one agent's git stash diagnostic step briefly reverted the whole working tree, self-recovered via git checkout from the stash + verified file/line counts matched pre-incident state before reporting done. No work lost, confirmed by this session's own post-round audit (git status count, diff-stat pure-churn scan, tsc baseline all matched expectations).

tsc: 101 errors, same baseline, no regression.

CP-10 P0/P1/P2 done. Still not started: P3+ UI (floor view seat picker, merge-preview confirmation dialog, split-by-seat settlement screen) — this is the part staff actually touch. Also still pending: prisma generate + running the 13 new migrations (0025-0037) against a real DB — both need to happen outside this sandboxed shell before any of this code path actually works end-to-end.

## 2026-09-01 — CP-12 User Management design/wiring audit — complete

Audited apps/api/src/routes/user-management.ts + apps/pos-web/pages/user-management.tsx (already had most CRUD, unlike other tabs this session). Found and fixed:

- SECURITY: page's useAuthGuard checked "menu.category.manage" (copy-paste leftover) instead of "users.manage" — any staff with menu access could open the whole user/role admin screen (API calls would 403 but the UI rendered and leaked org structure). Fixed.
- POST /users didn't validate outletId existed before use (role-assign endpoint did, create didn't) — fixed, plus added GET /outlets and replaced two raw-text "paste an outlet UUID" inputs with real dropdowns.
- DELETE /users/:id was a naive hard delete — would either throw an FK error or orphan Order.waiterId references for any user who ever worked a shift. Now checks UserRole/Session/UserQuickLink/Notification/Order.waiterId dependencies first and deactivates instead of deleting when any exist, same soft-delete-over-hard-delete convention used for vendors/recipes/customers earlier this session.
- PUT /roles/:id/permissions silently dropped invalid permission IDs — now reports them back, frontend surfaces a warning banner.

tsc: 101/0 (api/pos-web), unchanged baseline. Both agents touched the same 2 files concurrently, verified no corruption.

## 2026-09-01 — CP-13 Company Details sidebar — complete

New self-serve company profile, nothing hardcoded, blank until admin fills it:
- Outlet gained phone/email/logoUrl (migration 0038); GST/tax stays on Organization (was already there).
- GET/PATCH /settings/company — combined outlet+org read/write, scoped strictly to req.auth.outletId, gated settings.manage.
- GET /auth/me now passes phone/email/logoUrl through, so PosBillingView.tsx's receipt header picks up admin edits automatically without a second data source.
- New CompanyDetailsPanel.tsx + pages/settings/company.tsx + Nav.tsx sidebar entry under "Management", gated settings.manage. Every field starts truly empty (null → "") until saved for real.

tsc: 101/0, unchanged baseline.

## 2026-09-01 — CP-13 follow-up: User Management / Company Details were invisible on the POS Terminal

Root cause: this app has two disconnected nav systems. Nav.tsx's SIDEBAR_GROUPS (where User Management + Company Details links live) only renders on 12 admin-ish pages. The POS Terminal (pages/index.tsx, the default landing page) and several others (orders/kitchen/table-management/table-view) instead render the older KapMetaHeader.tsx drawer, which had a User Management link but buried 3 clicks deep inside a collapsed "Admin & A2A Operations" section under a confusing label ("Staff & RBAC Permissions"), and had NO Company Details link at all since that page was added directly into Nav.tsx only.

Fixed: added both as always-visible top-level rows in KapMetaHeader's drawer, sibling to the existing "Billing (POS)" item, no expand-to-find-it needed. tsc clean.

Flagging for a later pass, not fixed now: this two-nav-system split is itself worth resolving properly (either migrate the 5 remaining KapMetaHeader-only pages to the shared Nav sidebar, or vice versa) so future additions to one system don't silently fail to appear on the other's pages.

## 2026-09-01 — CP-14 Reports redesign: full granularity pass — complete

Audit found the existing reports (sales summary, item performance, payment/channel/tax breakdowns, leakage report, kitchen SLA) were already real and solid — no rework needed there, just extended the same pattern. Added 6 new report domains, 3 agents in parallel, all landing in the same reporting.ts/admin.tsx/reporting-service.ts stack without corruption (verified via combined tsc + git status after):

- Staff/waiter performance: orders, net sales, AOV, covers, tips (cash+digital), service charge, cash-variance per waiter.
- Table/floor utilization: per-table AND per-section occupancy%, avg turn time, revenue, plus a 24-bucket hourly occupancy heatmap per section.
- Menu margin/food-cost: per-item food cost % and margin via recipe/BOM join against ingredient unit cost — items with no recipe defined show hasRecipe:false and null cost/margin (never a fake 0-cost/100%-margin number), plus a summary of recipe coverage.
- Inventory variance: consumed vs purchased per ingredient, shortage/reasonCode breakdown, sorted worst-first.
- Wired the hourly-velocity/category-mix dashboard endpoint that already existed in executive-dashboard.ts but was never consumed by any UI — now a heatmap + category chart, zero new backend work.
- Customer/CRM insights: repeat-customer rate, top spenders, visit frequency.
- Discount & void analysis: void counts/value by reason/staff, discount totals/trend — response carries an explicit `note` field stating reason-level discount breakdown isn't possible without a schema change (no Discount entity exists yet), surfaced to the user in the UI rather than faked.
- Bonus fix: killed a leftover debug beacon (127.0.0.1:7323) firing on every Z-Report generation.

All new endpoints reuse the existing CSV/JSON export pattern in admin.tsx. tsc: 101/0, unchanged baseline.

Known gap, not fixed: reason-level discount breakdown needs a schema addition (Discount entity or discountReason field) if that granularity is wanted later.

## 2026-09-01 — CP-14 follow-up: "I don't see the reports"

Same disease as the User Management complaint, different limb. The reports were all real and rendering — but nothing led the user to them:

- Every nav link labeled "Sales Analytics"/"Sales Reports" pointed at bare /admin, which defaults to the daily-ops tab. The reports live in the analytics tab. So the label promised reports and the click delivered an ops dashboard. Fixed in both nav systems (Nav.tsx lines 34/86, KapMetaHeader line 686 + the whole Reports submenu) to carry ?tab=analytics. Nav.tsx's isActive already handled query-carrying hrefs, so highlighting was correct once the hrefs were.
- KapMetaHeader's "Reports" drawer section was collapsed by default (adminExpanded was already true — this one was just inconsistent). Now open by default.
- Reports submenu was also misleading: "Executive Sales Summary" went to bare /admin, "Order Sales Audit Report" went to an order list, "Item & Category Sales" went to /inventory. Rebuilt it to point at the five report surfaces that actually exist (analytics, Z-report/finance, kitchen prep times, waiter floor monitor, audit log).
- The analytics tab itself had become one ~1000-line scroll of 15 panels with no way to see what was in it. Added a report index at the top: a card grid, one per report, each with a plain-English line about what question it answers, click to smooth-scroll to it (scroll-margin-top clears the sticky topbar). Panels got stable ids; no data/computation touched.

Real report inventory confirmed while doing this (differs from what the earlier audit assumed): there is no standalone Revenue Trend panel and no standalone Table Turnaround panel — turnaround is a sub-line inside Channel Breakdown. 15 panels indexed.

tsc: 0 errors, pos-web baseline held.

Standing architectural debt, still unfixed: the two-nav-system split (Nav.tsx sidebar vs KapMetaHeader drawer) is what made both this and the User Management miss possible. Every new page must currently be wired into both or it silently disappears for half the app's pages.

## 2026-09-02 — CP-15 Design pass using vendored ui-ux-pro-max skill

Installed nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max-skill (123k stars, MIT) into .claude/skills — 7 skills, 10MB, mostly data catalogs. Note: the user asked for an "MCP"; the real project is a SKILL. An MCP wrapper of it exists (rofuniki-coder/ui-ux-pro-max-mcp) but has 1 star and no license — rejected on supply-chain grounds.

Judgment call worth recording: the skill's top recommendation for this app was Glassmorphism + a marketing "Operations Landing" pattern. Rejected — this is a touch-operated POS used on cheap screens in bright rooms for long shifts, and the skill's own data marks glassmorphism risk:conditional for contrast. Took its *guideline* data (contrast, touch targets, density profile) as authoritative instead of its style pick, and kept the app's existing token system, which is sound.

Wrote docs/03-design/artifact-03-design-contract.md as the shared contract all agents built against.

Measured (not eyeballed) WCAG audit found 3 real failures, all fixed:
- --text-muted #94a3b8 scored 2.56:1 on card / 2.45:1 on base. Now #6b7481 → 4.73 / 4.52. Notable: there is almost no headroom between muted and secondary at this bar (1.4% luminance gap), so the two are now separated by chroma rather than lightness.
- --accent #10b981 as text on light = 2.54:1. 12 sites moved to --accent-subtle-text (7.68:1). All ~36 fill usages left alone. Three ambiguous sites left and documented.
- Reports tab: sticky table headers (biggest single win on a 15-panel page), 36px rows, 12px padding, 122 numeric cells given tabular figures + right alignment, row hover, focus-visible outlines, prefers-reduced-motion block, print-safe overrides.

Both agents wrote admin.tsx concurrently and both flagged it. Verified after: all markers from both changesets present (10 contrast fixes, 38 analytics-surface refs, 122 num cells), tsc 0, no line-ending churn on any of the 16 touched files.

Two follow-ups queued, both real: TSK-015e (56 raw #94a3b8 literals still render at 2.56:1 — the token fix only reaches 47 of 134 muted-text sites) and TSK-015d (waiter.tsx + inventory.tsx are a *dark* Tailwind theme inside a light-token app, 840 bypasses — needs a dark-surface token set designed first, not a find-and-replace). Also found 6 phantom token names referenced but never defined, silently falling through to hardcoded fallbacks.

## 2026-09-02 — CP-16 Replicate 7 reference screens + a critical DB finding

5 agents. Audit mapped the 7 supplied screenshots against the app: sidebar ~85% there, Running Tables ~55% (wrong page), All Orders ~35%, Running Orders / Advance / Online / KOT-list ~10-15%.

THE IMPORTANT FINDING (agent A1, not something we went looking for): scripts/db-migrate.js caught ANY migration error, rolled back, then recorded the migration as applied. So a migration that genuinely failed is marked done forever and `npm run db:migrate` reports "already up to date". Migration 0022 is a confirmed victim — it rolled back on a missing table, so outbox_events and inventory_consumption_log were never created and have been throwing since (14,499 and 103 errors in logs/api/api-2026-09-02.log). settled_at, scheduled_fire_at, promised_at, deposit_minor, advance_status don't exist either. Logs suggest order_payments, item_availability, order_refunds, waiter_shift_handovers are also missing.
Fixed: the catch now only treats genuine duplicate-object codes (42P07/42710/42701/42P06/42723) as a safe no-op and re-throws everything else with code/detail/hint, unrecorded. Added scripts/db-verify.js + `npm run db:verify` to list migrations marked applied whose tables are absent.
A1 also refused to blind-apply the audit's drift list — it found three mutually incompatible `orders` lineages (0004, 0009, and the live Prisma baseline) and adding a non-existent column to a Prisma model breaks every query on that table. Only fields it could prove exist were added. business_date / customer_name / customer_phone / item_name / to_status remain unmodeled and ARE being written by integration.ts and tables.ts today — real breakage, needs a design decision (NOT NULL on a populated table).

Built: migration 0039; listOrders/getOrderDetail no longer return hardcoded nulls for customerName/waiterName/paymentMethod/channel (this alone unblocked 4 columns); GET /orders now returns a real total (pagination was also silently broken — `page` was written to a field the filter type doesn't have); new /orders/live/summary, /orders/online, /orders/advance/cumulative-items, /kitchen/kot/history; /tables/occupancy gained estimatedRevenueMinor; the aggregator webhook now persists channel/external id/customer/rider/OTP on the order instead of burying them in AuditLog.afterState.
Frontend: 4 new components incl. a dependency-free inline-SVG RevenueTrendChart (no chart lib existed and CDNs are blocked); all 5 order screens; KOT history at /kitchen?view=list with the reference's 5 status labels mapped from the schema doc block; both navs now render from one SIDEBAR_GROUPS.
Fake data removed: the hardcoded "(Non AC)" literal, AggregatorOrdersView's fake rider name/phone, the "Hotel kapila"/"R327038" outlet fallbacks.

tsc: pos-web 0, api 100 (one better than the 101 baseline). No line-ending churn across 24 files. NOT verified in a browser — `next build` can't run here (node_modules installed on Windows, no Linux SWC binary, no network).

## 2026-09-03 — Data Synchronization & Multi-Agent Wiring (complete)

- **Database Telemetry & Migration 0041:**
  - Added migration `0041_agent_telemetry.sql` to manage `agent_telemetry` table in PostgreSQL.
  - Synchronized `agent_telemetry` across both `petpooja` and `kapmeta` databases with all 8 autonomous agents.
- **Operational Roles & Permissions Sync:**
  - Standardized all 9 operational roles matching `ROLE-WISE-SCREEN-DIRECTORY.md` (`SUPER_ADMIN`, `ADMIN`, `OUTLET_MANAGER`, `CASHIER`, `WAITER`, `KITCHEN_USER`, `DELIVERY_MANAGER`, `INVENTORY_MANAGER`, `ACCOUNTANT`).
  - Mapped complete permission sets (228 assignments) across all operational roles in `role_permissions` table.
  - Seeded 8 staff operational user accounts with PIN `1234` and outlet access.
- **A2A Multi-Agent API & Heartbeat Wiring:**
  - In `apps/api/src/routes/admin.ts`, wired `POST /admin/agents/heartbeat` to support both `id` and `agentId`, update database telemetry, and broadcast `agent.heartbeat` across WebSockets.
  - Replaced hardcoded `activeWaiters: 3` and `agents: { total: 8, online: 8 }` in `GET /admin/daily-operations` with live database session and telemetry queries.
  - In `apps/api/src/routes/waiters.ts`, wired `POST /waiters/heartbeat` to touch the active database `Session` and broadcast `waiter.heartbeat`.
  - In `apps/api/src/routes/marketing.ts`, wired WebSocket event broadcasts (`marketing.campaign_created`, `marketing.campaign_queued`, `marketing.campaign_paused`).
  - In `apps/pos-web/components/A2aAgentStatusDrawer.tsx`, updated `handlePingHeartbeat` to send both `id` and `agentId` with `ONLINE` status.
  - Closed task `TSK-006` in `task-board.json`.
